# ZMW Analysis Platform (ZAP)
Matlab software for the analysis of single-molecule data obtained from ZMWs. 
Primary features will include:  
  1. Mask Maker: GUI for creating image masks (auto and manual) from image stacks
  2. Image Processing: GUI to find and identify single-molecules in image stacks to generate time-series data.  
  3. Time Series Viewer: GUI to navigate, select, and idealize (DISC) time-series data.
  4. Analysis: GUI for analysis of idealized time-series. 
  5. Simulation: GUI for simulating single-molecule trajectories. 
  
## Development
This is an ongoing project in devlopment. Check back for further announcements/ updates. 

## Authorship
All software written by David S. White. Some modules are built on started code provided by Marcel Goldschen-Ohm.
