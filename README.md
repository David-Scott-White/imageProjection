# ZMW Analysis Platform (ZAP)

## This work is under regular development and is not yet completed!

### Overview

Matlab build of an analysis platform and GUI for single-molecule imaging experiments of ligand binding using zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs). This repository integrates a variety of software written during my PhD work at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Primary features of the platform (will) include: 

* **Image Mask Creator**
    * create thresholded image masks to localize single-molecules in TIFF images 


* **Time Series Creator**
    * create time-series of intensity values at each localized single-molecule over a stack of TIFF images
    
    
* **Time Series Idealization**
    * integration of my recently published [DISC algorithm](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53357) for unsupervised identification of states and transitions in a given time series using top-down machine learning. 
    * DISC can also be found at: https://github.com/ChandaLab/DISC
    
    
* **Analysis**
    * General analysis of idealized time series including dwell time analysis, state occupancy analysis, bleach-step analysis, and exporting to QuB for more advanced hidden Markov modeling.
