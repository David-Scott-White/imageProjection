# ZMW Analysis Platform (ZAP)
Matlab build of an analysis platform for single-moleucle imaging in zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs). This repository integrates a variety of software written during the course of my PhD work at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Primary features of the repository include: 

* image mask creator 
** create thresholded image masks to localize single-molecules in TIFF images 

* image projection 
** create time-series at each localized single-molecule over a stack of TIFF images

* Time Series Idealization 
** Integration of my DISC algorithm (

# imageProjection
update roiProjection for ZMW/ TIRF imaging. Work in Progress
